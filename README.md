Introduction
The Rule Engine Web Application is a dynamic system that allows users to define and apply custom rules to process input data. The system evaluates these rules and provides the output based on the logic defined. This is particularly useful in areas such as business logic automation, workflow management, and decision-making systems.

Features
Rule Definition: Users can create new rules with conditions and actions.
Dynamic Rule Execution: Rules can be applied dynamically to different datasets without restarting the application.
User Interface: A web-based UI that allows users to define, edit, and delete rules.
Backend Rule Processing: A flexible backend engine that processes and evaluates rules in real time.
Customizable Actions: Supports defining custom actions to be performed when rules are matched.

Technologies Used
Java: Backend language.
Spring Boot: To manage dependencies, configuration, and application setup.
Spring MVC: For handling web requests.
JavaScript/HTML/CSS: For front-end user interface with interactive elements.
Thymeleaf: For server-side rendering of web pages.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: For rule and data persistence

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher
Spring Tool Suite (STS) or any other IDE supporting Spring Boot
Maven
MySQL/PostgreSQL

Configuration
Database Configuration: If using MySQL/PostgreSQL, set the appropriate connection details in application.properties.
Rule Storage: Rules can be stored in memory or persisted in a database depending on the requirement.

Usage
Open the application in your browser:
From the dashboard, you can:
Create new rules by specifying conditions and corresponding actions.
View existing rules and their status.
Edit or delete rules as needed.
Once rules are defined, they are processed dynamically on the backend. The system applies these rules to input data and triggers actions based on rule matches.

Architecture
The Rule Engine consists of three major components:

Rule Definition: Rules are defined using a UI or an external API. A rule consists of conditions and actions.

Rule Execution Engine: The engine evaluates conditions against input data. If a condition is met, the corresponding action is executed.

Actions: Actions are the outcomes or responses that are executed when rules match.

Rule Flow
Define Rule → Users define conditions and actions using the UI.
Input Data → Input data is fed into the engine for evaluation.
Process Rules → The engine processes each rule against the data.
Action Execution → If a rule's condition is met, the corresponding action is triggered.

Future Enhancements
Rule Versioning: Add support for rule version control, allowing users to roll back to previous rule versions.
Integration with External Systems: Add APIs to trigger external processes or systems based on rule evaluation.
Rule Templates: Pre-defined rule templates for faster rule creation.
Rule Testing Environment: Create a testing environment to test rules before deploying them live.
